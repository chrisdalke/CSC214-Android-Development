====== Lab Description ======

For this assignment, we were tasked with developing our understanding of
SQLite by building a simple list application that could have items added to it.
I used the models from the previous assignments that I built (Video Games)
and completed the assignment successfully.

When the app launches, there are no items in the list. To add items to the list,
click the + icon in the right, which brings up an activity to add an item.
Once you add a new item, it will appear in the list, which refreshes automatically.

======= Extra Credit ========

For extra credit, I added a menu option that uses a SQL query to clear
the entire database list. To clear the list, open the dropdown menu and click 'Reset'.
I also added validation on the item creation activity that displays an error
dialog if all the fields are not correctly filled out.

========= Files ======

The project for this assignment is contained in the /Assignment07 folder.
The screenshots and logs for this project are in the /SampleOutput folder.
