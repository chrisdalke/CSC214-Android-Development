====== Lab Description ======

For this assignment, we built an application that used multiple activities.
This tested our ability to set up more complex connections between activities.
I chose to use a Singleton pattern for the model, which made it easy to persist state
between all of the activities. the model instance is shared among all
the activities and fragments, which save to the object all the state properties.

======= Extra Credit ========

For extra credit, I configured some more complicated layout, setting
my configuration properties into view groups with headers.
