====== Lab Description ======

For this assignment, we worked on developing our skills with various aspects
of the android ecosystem. The lab contained a master/detail view with a
callback listener, a sound system, and tests of custom theming.

I completed all the stages of the assignment; I built a master-detail view
that displays a detail view for the sound effect when displayed in landscape
orientation. My sound effects continue playing when orientation is changed
since the fragment is persisted.
Lastly, I was able to set up the custom application theme and button skins.

I built my list of sound effects from online open source resources, described
in the extra credit section.

======= Extra Credit ========

For extra credit, I collected 25 high-quality sound effects from open source
online sound collections for use in the project. I chose to do this instead of
recording sound effects myself because it allowed me to have higher quality sounds.

========= Files ======

The project for this assignment is contained in the /Assignment08 folder.
The screenshots and logs for this project are in the /SampleOutput folder.
