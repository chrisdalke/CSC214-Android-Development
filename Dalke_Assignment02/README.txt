====== Lab Description ======

For this assignment we were tasked with setting up a layout in our activity, with several parts. The first part was to have two buttons that would show Toasts, which I placed at the top of the screen. We were also tasked with creating a label that would show a number starting at 100, and a button to decrement the number.

To control the number label, I created two helper functions that get and set the value of the number indicator in integer form. I used this for the decrement button, reset button, and an additional increment button.

======= Extra Credit ========

For extra credit, I made my layout a little more complicated to demonstrate my understanding of the material: I added an increment and decrement button on either side of the numerical label using a relative layout, and a reset button below the label. I also tweaked some of the settings on the elements so that they were arranged cohesively.

========= Files ======

The project for this assignment is contained in the /Assignment02 folder. The screenshots are in the /SampleOutput folder. There are no logs for this project since it is relatively simple.
