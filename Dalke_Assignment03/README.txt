====== Lab Description ======

This assignment tested our understanding of the application lifecycle. I completed all the parts of the assignment as we were prompted. To update the “Number of Orientation Changes” counter, I increment the counter value by 1 each time the value is loaded from the bundle in my onCreate method. Similarly, to maintain the correct image through the lifecycle I keep track of a variable recording the current image ID which is used to restore the image view.

======= Extra Credit ========

For extra credit, I made the layout a bit more complicated. Also, instead of simply cycling through the images, I made my application a random dice roller - so the button chooses a random dice face image.

========= Files ======
