====== Lab Description ======

For this assignment, we were tasked with building a test application
that would demonstrate our understanding of how to communicate data
between fragments. I completed the assignment. The activity communicates
the first message with the top fragment by generating a new fragment with
the message in the bundle data, and the top fragment uses the callback
interface pattern to communicate with the bottom fragment through the main
activity. This way, the fragments never directly communicate with each other.

======= Extra Credit ========

I did not complete any extra credit for this task, but I tried to extensively
comment my code and create a clean layout.

========= Files ======
