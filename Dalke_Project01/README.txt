==== Project Description ====

For this project, we were tasked with building a set of 2-player games.
I was able to implements all the games, as well as an extra credit game.
I chose to set up a separate model for each of my games, and created a
fragment for each of the game interfaces which is loaded up into a single
game activity that contains the scoreboard fragment and quit button.
This way, I minimized the number of activities I had and made the system
modular.

======= Extra Credit ========

For extra credit, I completed a number of tasks:
-I chose to develop all of the game interfaces as modular fragments rather than activities.
-I also chose to draw an image representation of the hangman for extra credit.
-Lastly, I implemented an extra game: Tic Tac Toe.

========= Files ======

Screenshots of the project are in the /SampleOutput folder.
